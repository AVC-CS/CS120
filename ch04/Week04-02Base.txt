                        - to get an executable code.
        
                . 4 components
                                source file (source.cpp)
                        pre-processor ( g++ -E source.cpp)
                                pre-processed file (source.i)
                        compiler (g++ -S source.i)
                                assembly file(source.s)
                        assembler (g++ -c source.o)
                                object-code(source.o)
                        linker(g++ source.o)
                                executable file
        [2] Program Design
                . Process of the development of Program
                        [Step 1]
                                Design the I/O 
                        [Step 2]
                                Variable Declarations
                                        Naming, Data Type, Const 
                        [Step 3]
                                Devise the programming logic (Calculation)
                        [Step 4]
                                Print out the results
                . Draw the Flow Chart
