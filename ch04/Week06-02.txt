⬜️ Today's Examples

[Ex1] Make the program that show the number of digits for the given user input.
        - User input should be a integer between 0 and 30,000.

        25000 / 10000 > 0 => number of digits = 5
        2000 / 1000 > 0 => number of digits = 4
        20 / 10 > 0 => number of digits = 2

[Ex2] Make the programt that find the largest number among random three numbers.

        seed = time(0)
        srand(seed)
        rand() 

[Ex 3] Calculates the circle, rectangle, and triangle area according the user choice
        User choice = 1,
                Circle Area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
        User Choice = 2,
                Rentangle Area = width * height;
        User Choice = 3,
                Triangle Area = width * height * 0.5;
        User Choice = 4,
                Progrm quit.
