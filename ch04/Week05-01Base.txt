⬜️ A summary of the last week

        Chater 4. Making Decision
        4.1 Relational Operators
                <, >, >=, <=, !, !=
        4.2, 4.3 if statement

                if ( condition )
                {
                        /* your code */
                } 
        4.4 else statement
                if ( condition ) {
                        /* code for the condition true */
                }
                else {
                        /* code for the condtion false */
                }
                [Ex 1] Make a program that check the input is odd or even number.
                [Ex 2] Make a program that check the sum of all user inputs are positive.
                        (1) Take the user inputs with 3 integer numbers.
                        (2) Sum all inputs.
                        (3) Check the sum is positive or negative.

⬜️ Today's Learning Outcomes
        4.5 nested if statement
                [Ex 3] Given the three user inputs(integer), check the duplicated numbers.
                [Ex 4] Make a program that check the number is a palidrome.
                [Ex 5] find the smallest value among the given three integers.
                [Ex 6] Score Grading
        4.6 else if statement 
        4.7 flags
                . A flag is a Boolean or integer variable that signals when a condition exists.  
        4.8 Logical Operators
                and, or, not =>  &&, ||, !
