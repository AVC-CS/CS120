⬜️ Summary of the last class

        [1] cin object
                the object is used to read user input from the keyboard.
        
        [2] Mathematical Expressions
                Precedence and Associativity(L to R) ( R to L) =, conditional Op. 
        [3] Type Conversion(implicit type casting)
                When you use the mixed data types in the expression,
                        int i=10;
                        float f=12.23;
                        // int result; 
                        float result; 
                        result = f / i ; 
                                // the actual result is the floating valeus
                                // the value i will be converted to the floating point values
                . the largest type 

        [4] Overflow and Undeflow

⬜️ Today's Learning Outcome
        [4] Overflow and Underflow
                - does not generate the "COMPILE ERROR"
                - It causes the "LOGICAL ERROR"(RUNTIME ERROR)
                        - difficult to find and fix it                

        [5] Type casting(Explicitly)
        [6] Multiple Assignments
        [7] Formatting output
        [8] Char and String
        [9] Mathematical Functions
                include        <cmath>
        
        - Programming Challeges 1, 2 => Programming Assignments 3-1( 5 Bonus Points)
                . Due is Friday(Jan 31)
