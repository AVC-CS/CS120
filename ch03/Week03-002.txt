⬜️ [Summary of the last week]

        Chapter 3 : Expressions and Interactivity

        [1] The cin object
                . the object is used to read the user input from the keyboard.
        
        [2] Mathematical Expressions   
                . Precedence and Associativity
        [3] Type Conversion
                . Impicit type converting when you use the mixed data type in the expression. 
                        int i = 10;
                        float f = 2.0;
                        float res1;
                        int res2;

                        res1 = i / f; the integer i will be converted to a float value.
                                        // floating division 
                        res2 = i / f ; 
                                  // the actual result is "float" but it will be stored to "integer variable"
                                  // "res" will be 5

        [4] Underflow and Overflow
                (1) Overflow
                        . INT_MAX + 1
                                // does not cause the complie error
                                // It causes the logical error and generates the wrong results
