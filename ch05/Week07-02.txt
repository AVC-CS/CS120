        5.1  ++, -- operators
        5.2  while loop
                = Pre-test loop. 
                        The condition is tested before the iteration body
                        . It could make 0 iteration
        5.5 do-while 
                - post-test loop        
                        . the condition is tested after the iteration
                        . There is at least 1 iteration(without condition test)
