        5.1 Increment and Decrement Operators
                ++, --
        5.2, 5.3, 5.4 While Loop
        
        - Basic While-loop structure
        - Examples
                Printing all ACSII codes (0-127)
                Input Validation
                Power Number to N
                Prime Number
                        is the number that
                                1) greater than 1
                                2) cannot be formed by multiplation by other numbers.
                        In other words,
                                When we divide by the numbers from 0 to the number itself,
                                the remainder is always not 0 except 1 and the number itself.
