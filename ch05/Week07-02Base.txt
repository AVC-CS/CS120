        Chapter 5. Loop and Files

        5.1 Increment and Decerement Operator
                ++, --
        5.2, 5.3, 5.4 While looop 
                . Pre-Test Loop
                        - The condition is tesed before the iteration body.
                        - It could make 0 iteration
        5.5 do-while Loop
                . Post-Test Loop
                        - The condition is tested after the itration body.
                        - There is at least 1 iteration.
                do {
                        //* Iteratino Body
                } while ( condition ) ;
 
⬜️ Today's Learning Outcome
        Examples
        - Power Numbers to 2
        - Prime Number Check
        - Summation 
                . the fixed range from 0 to N
                . multiple user inputs
                . the given user range
        - Find the min or max number 
                . among the user inputs
                . among the random Numbers
        - Get the number of integers that are satisfied with the certain condition.
                . The number of even numbers 
                . The input number is greater than the sum of previous two numbers.
                        . 1 3 5 7 15 25
                . The numbers are coming in increasing order.
        - Transform between loop structures.
